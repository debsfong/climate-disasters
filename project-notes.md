# Project Notes

- Don't use Atom for large files
    - Atom would freeze for a few minutes, make my laptop incredibly hot with the fan running on high, or crash
    - downloaded VSCode
- wanted to use jsona file from the FEMA website
    - maybe want to see if I can parse a csv file, so I did that instead
- using partial in views significantly slowed rendering
- How to display ALL disasters?
- Bug: color not displaying if there is only one state to display
    - issue with dividing by 0 when calculating the delta for the color
